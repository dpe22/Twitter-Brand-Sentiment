"Firm-wide remote work caused the collaboration network of workers to become more static and siloed, with fewer bridges between disparate parts." 

EfficeSpace's mission is to heal these wounds.

@mujer_cita_MIA They have done a lot for Africa and India. I have a personal connection to Bill Gates, he paid for my son’s education at MIT. He’s been working for Microsoft for over 25 years, doing very well. For all of Gates defects and warts I’m grateful to him.
