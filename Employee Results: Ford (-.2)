@rasforiowa @UAW Nothing should stop @UAW members in Detroit from working remotely at Deere Ankeny/Urbandale. And vice versa - Iowa UAW working for Ford remotely.. 
@mastropotato @BalanceMotoUK @newmacdroitwich I was working for Ford Motorcraft 30 years ago. Sold plenty of Fiesta I/IIexhausts. They all sounded the same. Farty and a bit weedy.. 
@maxfawcett @RobShaw_BC @AaronGunn "It's Justin's fault." It's working for Ford.. 
@CorreyCampbell @truth_tesla @garyblack00 multibillion dollar EV investment means nothing when you can't hire the talent to develop next gen tech in EV manufacturing.

College graduates aren't interested in working for Ford/GM/Stellantis. Tesla and SpaceX are in the top 5 places to work.. 
I think Iâ€™m the only person thinking of the regular person that would be able to find a job in Austin? Someday these people will be working for Ford or GM sooner than later. Tesla as an automaker is still a small fish in a big pond with whales.
