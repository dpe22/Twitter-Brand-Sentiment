# WORKING AT AMAZON Tweets and Sentiment Analysis
NFL commercials:
“JOIN the military \U0001f608 NOW \U0001f624 and you get to murder every middle eastern person you’ve ever seen\U0001f621 it’s kinda like video games \U0001f60e\U0001f3ae”
…
“Working at Amazon solved my mother’s cancer. I am eternally grateful to Amazon, so I have legally given them my consciousness.”. 
They turned off comments to avoid people mentioning just how shitty working for amazon is https://t.co/kYLXQ9KAdE. 
@KenDilanianNBC Not surprised at all given the horror stories of working for Amazon.. 
@SmattStephenson Healthcare assistants get paid minimum wage, they’ll get better pay &amp; conditions working for Amazon, pay better salary and you’ll attract people. 
Working for Amazon went a little like this \u2764 https://t.co/0MHsYkC62u. 
@Woodlandsystem3 Libraries have free internet and wifi.  Phones are subsidized by government if you're low income.   Food pantries hand out free groceries.  Help wanted signs literally EVERYWHERE.  Go make $19/hr working for Amazon.. 
The only downside of working at Amazon is that the break rooms are on different sides of the world \U0001f972\U0001f972. 
Fr me when I was working at amazon in school\U0001f602\U0001f602 If i can be pretty then im simply not working here. https://t.co/cmZ9viqgpA. 
@JamesVGrimaldi @WSJ @AllisonPrang I'm not surprised. Tech workers do have skills which can be transferred into other companies VERY easily. If you're tech worker working for Amazon, you can easily change employers. Sounds like Amazon lost enough key tech workers to figure out what's going on.. 
new world feels like a social experiment to see how long the person is willing to do tasks with no reward
i.e working at amazon
